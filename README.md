# Statistical Learning for Big Data : my solution to the Final Exam
The only purpose of this repository is to show what I can produce on basic Machine Learning tasks with numerical Data.  
I managed to get a 4 / 5 at this exam.

## Intructions 
You can find the instructions [here](msa220_mve441_exam_june2021.pdf)

## Modules
I use `pandas`, `NumPy` and `scikit-learn`

## Some recomandations
There is 3 tasks, each one has a dedicated written report. The notebook contains the code of each task one after the other.   
I totaly recommend that you start your reading with the [reports](/Assignement) then dig into the [code](Code.ipynb) if you want to.  
  
Enjoy your reading.
